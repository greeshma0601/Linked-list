/*
Full binary tree
Given a Binary tree, your task is to check whether the Binary tree is a full binary tree or not.

Input:
First line consists of T test case. First line of every test case consists of N, denoting number of Nodes in a binary tree. Second line of every test case consists 3*N elements 2 integers and a character.

Output:
Single line output, return true if it is a full binary tree else false.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100

Example:
Input:
2
4
1 2 L 1 3 R 2 4 L 2 5 R
3
1 2 L 1 3 R 2 4 L
Output:
1
0
